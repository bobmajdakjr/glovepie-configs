Bob's GlovePIE Xbox controller config files.

These allow GlovePIE to map gamepad input to normal keyboard/mouse.

You will need to alter the keys to match your bindings. For example
if you use WSAD instead of the arrow keys you will need to modify
the config file for that because screw you I play left handed. :)
